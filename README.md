# [TRS](https://teacherrecsystem.tech/)

## Intro

Teacher Recommender System (TRS) is a Google Sheet Add-On built with server-side Google Apps Script (GAS) and frontend Javascript, HTML, CSS (MaterializeCSS), and Vue (currently being integrated). The code is organized into frontend, backend, development (code generators, automated testing, miscl.).

## Files and Folders

### .clasp.json

This file contains the id of the Google Sheet (GS) where clasp is pushing the code. Change this to your own testing GS.

### .claspignore

This file contains files/folders that clasp will not push. Just like .gitignore

### appscript.js

I think this enables VSCode GAS autocomplete support.

### appsscript.json

This contains the scopes
