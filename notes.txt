//TODO security, switch forms from edit when sharing stuff with users enabled...

weird thing happens w final send button updates?

maybe ask how much time has been saved on forms
handle students w/same name? show it to college counselors so they can deal w it

handle runtime barrier
email people when forms all done being created?

Alphabetize teacher names in list

Must always handle Other last

 for (var x = 0; x < teacherNameCol.length; x++) {
    teacherNameCol[x] = teacherNameCol[x][0];
    responseRecordedColVals[x] = responseRecordedColVals[x][0];
  }

  handle teachers who no students selected appropriately

  handle teachers with no result

  Math.floor(studentFormEmail.getMessage().getDate() /1000)


  make note that probably will break due to timeout if u dont have a paid account


  maybe fix this with lazy triggers?
